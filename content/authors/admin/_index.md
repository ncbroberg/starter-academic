I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the European University Institute (EUI), working under the supervision of Andrea Ichino and Andrea Mattozzi. 

I am also Research Associate at the Migration Policy Centre within the Robert Schuman Centre at the EUI. 

My research interests include applied microeconometrics, political economy, migration, labour, and public economics.
