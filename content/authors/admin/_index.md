I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the European University Institute (EUI), working under the supervision of Andrea Ichino and Andrea Mattozzi.

I am also a Research Associate at the Migration Policy Centre within the Robert Schuman Centre at the EUI.

My research interests include political economy, migration, and public economics.
