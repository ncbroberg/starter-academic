Hello and welcome to my website! 

I am an applied economist interested in education, migration, and political economy. I work as an analyst within the [OECD](https://www.oecd.org/)'s Directorate for Education and Skills. 

Prior to joining the OECD, I was a Research Associate at the [Migration Policy Centre](https://migrationpolicycentre.eu/) at the [Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/robert-schuman-centre-for-advanced-studies).

I received my PhD from the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/department-of-economics) under the supervision of Andrea Ichino and Andrea Mattozzi in May 2022. 

You can find my CV [here](uploads/CV.pdf).
